# Painoboard
Painoboard is an algorithm and software which map panio keyboard as normal computer keyboard with the **right keyboard layout**. Use **Seq2Seq learning** to map panio's mostlly used `chords(left-hand)` and `melody(right-hand)` to `word affix` and `word frequency`. So user can use that as dailly driver and also pratice panio at the same time.

[QWERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) is designed counter productive and not intuitive at all. So can `Keyboard` become `the keyboard`?
